## Runic in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)

Runic is a multiplayer 2D survival game with a simple vector art style. The premise is to collect resources and build structures. It is ~~a ripoff of~~ inspired by Moomoo.io.

I plan to add a magic system with tomes and runes, thus the name.

I also plan to add a crafting system similar to Terraria, where you get close to the necessary crafting table to craft an item in a menu. You can craft tools, walls, and other objects.

As of yet, multiplayer has not been implemented. I plan on using Godot Engine's own high level multiplayer API.

This game was originally made in basic Javascript as a learning opportunity, but it was too time consuming to roll new things out so I'm porting it to Godot. I already learned what I needed to learn, so this is just to keep the project alive. You can find the Javascript version here:
